    <h2>Scope and Deliverables</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The data and record are kept inside an Obsidian vault and used for collecting and retrieving data. 
        Any data that is wanted to executed has to be brought inside this vault.</li>
        <li>The intended result is a dashboard that can be used to track my learning progress and 
        also a CLI application that can be used for generating study dashboard and execute primary functions.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class = "MethodologyAndApproach">
    <h2>Methodology and Approach</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Obsidian vault for creating files and record of learning activities</li>
        <li>Template files are store in template folder in Obsidian vault to create semi-structure files, easier for collecting and retrieving data. Files included are study logging, study report and study note</li>
        <li>CLI tool to perform pre-setted tasks</li>

<div class = "RiskAssessment">
    <h2>Risk assessment</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>School work is the top priority, so this project can be delayed due to school work overload</li>
        <li>Learning curve when building the application. The core and functionalities can be handled in Python for prototyping. Lack of understanding and experience in Java and database management</li>
        <li>Testing methodologies and strategies are not clear until the code is planned and built properly</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class = "TimelineAndMilestones">

        <li>May 23rd, 2024. <strong>Update on the architecture of the project.</strong> Reset the environment for version 2's development. Manage dependencies issues</li>
        <li>May 25th, 2024. <strong>Visioning an application that can search for related documents with a searching prompt with Vector Retrival</strong>. Implement text extraction for keyword clusterizer.</li>
        <li>May 27th, 2024. <strong>Change in command lines and application structure.</strong> Prioritize the static content and searching method to finish the project</li>
        <li>May 29th, 2024. <strong> Finish implementing static part of the project.</strong> Begin implementing vector retrival for related keyword search</li>
        <li>Jun 6th, 2024. Mass delay due to school work overload. <strong>A proposal for more managable task list generation is created.</strong></li>
        <li>Jun 19th, 2024. <strong>Make randomization in task list generation more distributed, ideally every book should be read once</strong></li>
        <li>Jun 26th, 2024. <strong>Add a note review system</strong> to encourage revisiting old notes for more expansion</li>
        <li>Aug 6th, 2024. <strong>Re-run the program at full scale.</strong> Eliminate unused features and clean up the code base</li>
        <li>Aug 7th, 2024. Add features to generate word frequency report analysis for <strong>further linguistic analysis</strong></li>
        <li>Aug 11th, 2024. <strong>Refactor the code</strong> to make sure no memory overflow when collecting big amount of data</li>
        <li>Aug 12th, 2024. <strong>Change the name of this project to LearnCraft.</strong></li>
        <li>Aug 22nd, 2024. <strong>ImplementTF-IDF comparison failed</strong> Refactor the code</li>

        <li>Aug 29th, 2024. <strong>Final decision</strong> Implement TF-IDF is removed due to time cosuming computation and lack of solution to optimize time performance</li>
        <li>Aug 30th, 2024. Prototype is <strong>sufficiently done.</strong> Considering migrating to C++ for faster computation</li>
        <li>Aug 31st, 2024. Prototype is <strong>done in Python.</strong> Considering tokenization process in low level language like C++ or Rust language</li>
        <li>Oct 4th, 2024. This project is repurposed to <strong>textual data preparation and search by references</strong> with Python natual language processing and C++ numerical computation</li>
        <li>Oct 5th, 2024. <strong>CLI mocked-up look is created in C++ program. Easier to manage features included in the program.</strong></li>
        <li>Oct 6th, 2024. The programming is now running in both Python and C++ because some features are tied to Natural Language Processing. <strong>Update on the architecture of the project.</strong></li>
